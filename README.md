# Deep-Learning-using-Keras
This is my first project in deep learning as a data analyst enthusiast. 
It demonstrates the core deep learning model building concepts using the Keras library. 
The Iris flower dataset is used to build the model and perform classification tasks

I had to perform the following as the entire process
## 1. Prepare Input Data for Deep Learning
Perform the following steps for preparing data

- Load data into a pandas dataframe
- Convert the dataframe to a numpy array
- Scale the feature dataset
- Use one-hot-encoding for the target variable
- Split into training and test datasets

## 2. Creating a Model
Creating a model in Keras requires defining the following

- Number of hidden layers
- Number of nodes in each layer
- Activation functions
- Loss Function & Accuracy measurements

## 3. Model Training and Evaluation
Training the model involves defining various training models and then perform forward and back propagation.
- Setup hyper parameters for training. i.e
   -Batch size
   - Epochs
   - Validation split
   - Verbose
## 4. Saving and Loading models

The training and inference environments are usually separate. Models need to be saved after they are validated. They are then loaded into the inference environments for actual prediction
## 5. Predictions with Deep Learning Models
